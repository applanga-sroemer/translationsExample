The goal of this project is to present the different solutions to translate an iOS app, like the (TodoMVC)[https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc] app of translations.

The `master` branch contains a non-translated app, other branches present each a backend service 

# No backend

# Babelish

Command-line tool that uses a CSV file as a backend (eventually hosted on Google Docs) to generate .strings files.

# Transifex

Service that manages resources, supports a lot of formats in addition of Apple's formats (.strings / ,plist).
